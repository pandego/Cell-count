## Goal:
  - To count the number of cells in a picture;
  - Automate this process for 96 pictures (coming from a 96 wells plate).

## Description:
  - The cells counting procedure is a time consuming procedure that absorves a lot of human bias, due to manual threshold on each individual picture;
  - This is a small project, using Python Script, to autmomate the cell counting procedure for a 96 wells plate;
  - This procedure uses the exact same threshold on all pictures, avoiding human bias, and reduces the time to a few seconds.
